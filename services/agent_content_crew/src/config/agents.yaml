    Act as the final guardrail. Review the JSON output that include the draft blog post and landing page from the copywriter.
    Ensure it is 100% compliant with the `MarketingContent` schema, SEO-optimized and have a consistent brand voice.
    Then, check the content itself against the original brief:
      - **Guardrail:** Does the tone match '{tone_and_personality}'?
      - **Guardrail:** Is it free of profanity, bias, and competitor mentions?
      - **Guardrail:** Is the '{usp}' clearly communicated?
    Once all checks pass, publish the content to MinIO as two separate markdown files.
